        <h2>How AI Helped Me Plan the Perfect Hockey Road Trip</h2>
        <p>
          Planning a road trip can be exciting, but it can also be
          overwhelming—especially when trying to juggle schedules, ticket
          prices, hotel bookings, and budgeting. For my recent hockey road trip,
          I decided to take a different approach: I used AI to help me
          streamline the entire process. The result? A stress-free,
          well-organized, and budget-friendly getaway that let me focus on
          enjoying the experience rather than sweating the details.
        </p>

        <div class="step">
          <h3>The Challenge: Planning a Multi-City Trip on a Budget</h3>
          <p>
            I knew I wanted to take a weekend road trip to catch a couple of
            hockey games, but I wasn’t sure where to start. My main goals were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Finding the best combination of games that fit within a reasonable
              driving distance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keeping costs as low as possible without sacrificing comfort.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensuring the trip was well-structured so I wouldn’t have to
              scramble last-minute.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Enter AI.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h3>How AI Made Trip Planning Easy</h3>
          <h4>1. Finding the Best Game Schedule</h4>
          <p>
            Instead of manually searching through multiple team websites and
            trying to piece together an itinerary, I asked AI to find all
            available pro and semi-pro hockey games happening within a six-hour
            drive of Myrtle Beach, SC, between March 28th and 30th. Within
            moments, I had a comprehensive list of options spanning the NHL,
            AHL, ECHL, and even women's leagues.
          </p>

          <h4>2. Budgeting & Cost Estimation</h4>
          <p>
            One of the most stressful parts of trip planning is managing
            expenses. I asked AI to break down estimated costs for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Event/Entertainment budget (finding the cheapest available tickets
              and mid-range options).
            </li>
            <li>Hotel stays in Raleigh and Charlotte.</li>
            <li>
              Rental car costs (with pickup and drop-off at Myrtle Beach
              Airport).
            </li>
            <li>Parking fees at each arena.</li>
            <li>Gas expenses for the estimated miles driven.</li>
            <li>Food costs, with budget-friendly and mid-range options.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>3. Creating an Easy-to-Follow Itinerary</h4>
          <p>
            Once the plan was finalized, AI helped me structure the trip into a
            simple, step-by-step checklist.

          <h3>The Outcome: A Stress-Free, Fun-Filled Weekend</h3>
          <p>
            Because AI handled the heavy lifting of researching and organizing,
            I was able to focus on what really mattered—enjoying the games! The
            entire trip felt well-paced and easygoing.
          </p>

          <h3>Would I Do It Again? Absolutely.</h3>
          <p>
            If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed planning a trip, I highly recommend
            giving AI a shot. It’s like having a personal travel planner in your
            pocket—ready to help you optimize your plans, find the best deals,
            and make sure you don’t miss a thing.
