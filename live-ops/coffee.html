      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Common Ground World (Town Star) is a competitive town-building game that
        runs weekly live-ops events, where players compete to produce the most
        of a specific crafted item. Throughout the Coffee Craze event line,
        players raced to produce Coffee, Hot Cocoa & more, with a real Hasty
        Barista Blueprint NFT (a skin for the Coffee Shop) as the prize.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Winter 2024, I designed and coordinated the
        <strong>Coffee Craze</strong> live-ops event line for
        <strong>Common Ground World</strong>, blending player feedback, seasonal
        storytelling, strategic map design, and NFT integration to create an
        engaging, monetized gameplay experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I owned the event end-to-end — from planning and execution to iteration.
        I designed the game economy around the new crafts weekly, wrote all
        player-facing comms, coordinated the launch of multiple new themed NFTs,
        and used it as a test case for refining the weekly event loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Taglines for the event series (written by me):</strong><br />
        <strong>Week 1: </strong>"<em
          >May victory go to the swiftest and finest brew, and let our coffee
          cups overflow with laughter and the spirited camaraderie of caffeine
          enthusiasts!</em
        >"<br /><strong>Week 2: </strong>"<em
          >Turn your cozy town into a simmering cauldron of creamy goodness. The
          only thing hotter than the cocoa is the competition!</em
        >"<br /><strong>Week 3: </strong>"<em
          >Whether you're a brewmaster or a cocoa commander, this event promises
          a delightful blend of fun, froth, and a town buzzing with the sweet
          aroma of Mocha.</em
        >"
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Origin of Idea:</strong> The event was inspired by community
        discussions highlighting a desire for coffee-themed content. I saw an
        opportunity to meet that demand with a cozy, seasonally appropriate
        series of events after the winter holidays — when players were returning
        from breaks and looking for fresh, fun content. By aligning gameplay
        with both player sentiment and seasonal vibes, I led the initiative to
        bring this idea to life, demonstrating a data-driven, player-first
        approach to live event design.

    <div class="content-box" id="design">
      <h2>Map and Gameplay Design</h2>
      <p>
        For this event, I selected the Mountain Biome with freshwater sources as
        the foundation for gameplay. Its natural abundance of water made it a
        logical fit for a coffee-themed event while staying consistent with
        established in-game logic. The uneven terrain of the map introduced a
        layer of complexity that encouraged more strategic placement and
        planning. By integrating this design with existing dairy and chocolate
        production chains, players were incentivized to revisit and reuse legacy
        systems in a meaningful way. Resource availability on the map was
        carefully balanced to subtly encourage NFT use without making it a
        requirement. This allowed both free and paying players to compete
        meaningfully, while still rewarding those who invested in assets. I also
        made deliberate use of older NFTs like the Fancy Barn and Chocolatier,
        tying them directly into the new crafting chain to enhance their
        long-term value and relevance.
      </p>

      <h2>NFT Design</h2>
      <p>
        Two new NFTs were introduced as part of this event: the Coffee Cart and
        the Hot Cocoa Chalet. The Coffee Cart passively generates coffee beans
        and features a whimsical aesthetic aligned with the seasonal theme,
        offering casual players a helpful tool without requiring complex inputs.
        The Hot Cocoa Chalet was designed to function as a premium crafter,
        processing ingredients faster than the free version while maintaining
        output parity to ensure balance. NFT benefits were intentionally
        moderate—noticeable enough to feel rewarding, but not so strong that
        they undermined competitive fairness. This approach helped maintain
        accessibility while still offering compelling reasons to participate in
        the broader NFT economy.
      </p>

      <h2>Community Strategy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Community-driven content inspired by player feedback</li>

        </li>
        <li>Live Town Halls with sneak peeks, AMAs, and giveaways</li>
        <li>Real-time feedback monitoring and responsive event adjustments</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cross-Functional Collaboration</h2>
      <ul>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box" id="results">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased DAUs (Daily Active Users) during event period</li>
        <li>High engagement on Discord and Twitter (X)</li>
        <li>
          Positive community sentiment around legacy NFT use and event design
        </li>

      <h2>Player Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        Players expressed excitement about the new crafting systems and the
        thematic integration of coffee and cocoa into gameplay. The event was
        well-received for its balance of challenge and accessibility, with many
        players praising the thoughtful design of the map and the strategic
        opportunities it presented. The phased release strategy kept players
        engaged and eager for each new installment, while the community-driven
        approach fostered a sense of ownership and pride in the event's success.
