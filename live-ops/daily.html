      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the Town Star (Common Ground World) live-ops team, I led the
        design and delivery of a fully integrated daily challenge ecosystem
        built around blockchain mechanics, play-to-earn dynamics, and NFT
        ownership utility. My work brought together gameplay design, tokenomics,
        and real-time community feedback to create repeatable, engaging live
        service loops.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each daily event required careful coordination across game economy
        design, reward structures, and map mechanics. The system incentivized
        both daily logins and long-term player investment, while also aligning
        with seasonal progression and the evolving "Meta."
      </p>
      <p>
        Working closely with cross-functional partners, I helped define the
        structure of our token economy (see <a href="#">Litepaper</a>) and
        ensured that each challenge provided meaningful engagement for both
        casual and competitive players.
      </p>

      <h2>Daily and Weekly Content Flow</h2>
      <p>
        Live-ops success depends on rhythm, variety, and consistent quality. I
        led the live deployment of daily events with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>7 new gameplay challenges per week</strong>, designed with
          progressive complexity and player retention in mind
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>7 procedurally generated map layouts</strong> tied to the
          weekly resource economy and Meta
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Daily NFT gating</strong> to incentivize ownership and
          encourage peer-to-peer trading
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Weekly challenge guides</strong> and wrap-up posts with
          community stats, economy recaps, and strategic tips
        </li>
        <li>
          Real-time content calendar updates and community announcements via
          Discord, Twitter/X, Instagram, and Facebook
        </li>
        <li>
          Close QA collaboration to ensure bug-free launches and fast hotfix
          turnarounds
        </li>
      </ul>

        Not every day goes perfectly‚Äîsometimes things break. One day, the update
        that normally delivers the daily challenge content didn‚Äôt go through
        properly. Rather than post a dry apology, I chose to tell a
        light-hearted story using our game‚Äôs voice, turning a frustrating moment
        into something that made players smile. The final tweet below shows how
        even ‚Äúno event‚Äù can still be an opportunity for creative community
        engagement.

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        Every challenge was more than a content drop‚Äîit was a system. I
        approached design with a focus on modularity, player-driven pacing, and
        NFT strategy integration. Weekly metas shaped the maps and resource
        flows. New building placements, token pools, and difficulty tiers were
        introduced regularly to keep engagement high.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also collaborated on crafting tree design (tech trees), seasonal
        recipe updates, and yield balancing across crops, factories, and
        units‚Äîensuring players had to strategize resource flows and NFT utility
        effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        For daily events, each game brings its own challenges. With Town Star, I
        focused on rotating themes and maps to keep the gameplay fresh, while
        making sure different NFTs could be utilized across a variety of events.
        It was important to me that players felt their investments in NFTs
        continued to have value and use in the daily events, preventing any
        sense of wasted money or unused assets. A big part of live-ops in a
        monetized game is maintaining that balance and keeping players engaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Integrating new mechanics or features into a live game can be tough, but
        I found sticking to a firm update schedule worked best. For Town Star,
        we rolled out updates weekly, on the same day and time, so players knew
        when to expect short downtime and planned around it. Keeping that
        predictability in place helped build trust with the community and
        minimized disruption, ensuring a smooth player experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also monitored player sentiment daily, rapidly adjusting challenge
        formats based on in-game analytics and community feedback. These
        feedback loops directly informed economy rebalancing, challenge reward
        tiers, and map difficulty progression.
