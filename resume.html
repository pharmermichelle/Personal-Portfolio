        <p>
          I've led teams in restaurants, managed communities of thousands, and
          helped ship live features as a product manager. Whether it's guiding
          players, customers, or cross-functional teams, I bring a steady hand,

          games, tech, and healthcare, I'm ready to take on bigger leadership
          roles where people and products meet.

          I'm a product-minded builder with a background in community strategy,

          edge of structure and creativity—especially when there's a chance to
          make something people actually enjoy using.
